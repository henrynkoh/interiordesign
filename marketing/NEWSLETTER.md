## Pro Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Multiple Generations

Don't settle for the first result! Generate 2-3 times with the same style to get more options. Each generation creates unique variations, giving you more choices.

**How to do it:**
1. Generate your first design
2. Download favorites
3. Generate again with same style
4. Compare all variations
5. Select best options

### Tip 2: Style Comparison

Generate the same floor plan in all 6 styles to see which works best. This helps you:
- Understand style differences
- Find your preference
- Show clients options
- Make informed decisions

### Tip 3: File Organization

Keep your projects organized from the start:

```
Projects/
  ├── Project-Name/
  │   ├── Floor-Plans/
  │   ├── Modern/
  │   ├── Scandinavian/
  │   └── Final-Selections/
```

Use descriptive file names:
- "living-room-modern-1.png"
- "bedroom-scandinavian-2.png"

### Tip 4: Quality Floor Plans

Better input = better output. Invest time in preparing quality floor plans:
- High resolution (1200x900+ pixels)
- Good contrast
- Clear labels
- Standard symbols
