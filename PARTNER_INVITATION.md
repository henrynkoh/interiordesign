**Subject:** Invitation to Test & Provide Feedback: Interior Design Generator

Hi [Partner Name],

I hope this message finds you well! I'm reaching out because I've been developing an innovative project and would greatly value your expertise and feedback.

**Introducing: Interior Design Generator**

I've created an AI-powered web application that transforms simple floor plan images into photorealistic interior design visualizations in just 60 seconds. This tool addresses a significant pain point in the interior design and architecture industry: the high cost ($1,500-$2,000) and long wait times (2-3 weeks) of traditional 3D rendering.

**What Makes It Special:**
• **AI-Powered**: Uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 for professional-quality generation
• **Fast**: Results in 30-90 seconds vs. weeks
• **Affordable**: $2-$10 per generation vs. $1,500+ traditional
• **Multiple Styles**: 6 professional design styles (Modern, Scandinavian, Industrial, Traditional, Contemporary, Bohemian)
• **High Quality**: 1024x1024 resolution images suitable for presentations
• **User-Friendly**: No design experience required

**How It Works:**
1. Upload a floor plan image (drag & drop or click)
2. Select a design style
3. Wait 30-90 seconds for AI generation
4. Receive 4 unique design variations
5. Download high-resolution images

**I Would Greatly Appreciate Your Feedback On:**
